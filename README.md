# computer_vision_3
we were tasked with implementing
three separate classifiers for scene recognition. The first classifer
created was a simple K-Nearest neighbour classifier; the
second was a series of linear classifiers using a visual bag of
words feature; and for the third we attempted to implement
a self-trained Convolutional Neural Network.
